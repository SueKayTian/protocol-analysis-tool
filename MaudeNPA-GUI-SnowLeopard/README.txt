Maude-NPA GUI for MacOSX-10.5
----------------------------

  1. INTRODUCTION
  -----------------

	This document gives instructions for the installation of this version
	of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the Maude-NRL Protocol 
	Analyzer (Maude-NPA). 

	The aim of this graphical user interface is to give the user a complete 
	animation of the Maude-NPA search tree generation process which 
	she can control at will. 


  2. INSTALLATION
  -------------
	The current version of the Maude-NPA GUI works on Mac OS 10.4 and 
        Mac OS 10.5 and we also plan to develope a version for Linux. 

	The Maude-NPA GUI requires the Graphviz library to be installed on your 
	computer. Thus, before start using the Maude-NPA GUI, please, download 	
	this library from the following web site: 

	    www.graphviz.org/Download.php

	We have tested the Maude-NPA GUI on Graphviz versions 2.20.2 and 2.24.0
	 for Mac OS X 10.5. 

	Note that there is no binary installation package for Mac 10.4. Instead, 
	you should download the source files from the following link: 

	    www.graphviz.org/Download_source.php 

	and build them. For Mac OS X 10.4, we have also tested the Maude-NPA GUI 
	on Graphviz versions 2.20.2 and 2.24.0.

	Once you have installed Graphviz on your computer, you should download
        the Maude-NPA GUI installation package that corresponds to your operating 
	system, which is available online at: 

		www.dsic.upv.es/grupos/elp/Maude-NPA_GUI
 
	Finally, you only have to unpack the installation package at any directory 
	of your file system.


  3. START USING THE MAUDE-NPA GUI
 -------------------------------

	 In order to start using the Maude-NPA GUI you have to enter into the 
	 directory where you installed Maude-NPA GUI. In this directory there is
	 an executable file called start which sets some necessary environment 
	 variables and launches the tool. To execute this file you should type in 
	 the command line the following command:

	 ./start

	 After doing this, the main window of the GUI will appear. This window allows	
	 the user to load a protocol specification, either from his or her file system
	 or one of the example protocol specification examples, provided by the tool.

	 For more information about the Maude-NPA GUI features, we refer the user 
	 to the  installation and user manual available online at:

	 	www.dsic.upv.es/grupos/elp/Maude-NPA_GUI/doc/Maude-NPA_GUI-manual-v0.1.pdf
