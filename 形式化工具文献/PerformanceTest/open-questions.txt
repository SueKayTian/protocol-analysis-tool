- SATMC has a limit in the config files, what does this mean? 

    satmc.config, line 22 : "max=30"

  What is the meaning of this maximum and does it influence
  behaviour/termination?

  A: After inquiry with the authors, they have stated that this should
  not be a problem, as they have not encountered hitting this limit, and
  had even disabled it in their own tests. They put it in to enforce
  termination in cases of e.g. loops. 
  After testing anew with the limit disabled, it has turned out this
  does not influence our tests.
